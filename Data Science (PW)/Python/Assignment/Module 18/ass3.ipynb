    "In Python, the `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()` methods are used to read data from a file. Each method has different behavior and use cases. Here's an explanation of each, along with examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `read()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read()` method reads the entire contents of a file and returns it as a string. It can also accept an optional parameter specifying the number of bytes to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Create a file with some content\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello, World!\\nWelcome to Python file handling.\\nHave a great day!\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Read the entire file content\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(\"Using read():\")\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using read():\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "Welcome to Python file handling.\n",
    "Have a great day!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `readline()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `readline()` method reads a single line from the file. It moves the file pointer to the start of the next line after reading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read one line at a time\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    print(\"Using readline():\")\n",
    "    first_line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(\"First Line:\", first_line)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    second_line = file.readline()\n",
    "    print(\"Second Line:\", second_line)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using readline():\n",
    "First Line: Hello, World!\n",
    "\n",
    "Second Line: Welcome to Python file handling.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `readlines()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `readlines()` method reads all the lines of the file and returns them as a list of strings, where each string is a line from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Read all lines as a list\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    lines = file.readlines()\n",
    "    print(\"Using readlines():\")\n",
    "    for line in lines:\n",
    "        print(line, end=\"\")  # Use end=\"\" to avoid adding extra newlines\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using readlines():\n",
    "Hello, World!\n",
    "Welcome to Python file handling.\n",
    "Have a great day!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`read()`**: Reads the entire file or a specified number of bytes and returns it as a single string.\n",
    "- **`readline()`**: Reads one line at a time and returns it as a string.\n",
    "- **`readlines()`**: Reads all lines and returns them as a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each method is useful depending on how you want to process the file data. Use `read()` for simple cases where you need all the data at once, `readline()` when you need to process lines one by one, and `readlines()` when you need to work with all lines as a list."
