    "The `close()` function is used to close an open file in Python. It's important to close a file for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Management:**\n",
    "   - When a file is opened, the operating system allocates resources such as memory and file descriptors to manage the file. Closing the file releases these resources, making them available for other processes. Failing to close files can lead to resource leaks and limit the number of files you can open simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Integrity:**\n",
    "   - When writing to a file, data is often buffered, meaning it is temporarily stored in memory before being written to disk. Closing a file ensures that all buffered data is flushed, meaning it is actually written to the file. This prevents data loss and ensures that all changes are saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoiding File Corruption:**\n",
    "   - Leaving files open can sometimes lead to file corruption, especially if the program crashes or the system shuts down unexpectedly. By closing a file, you minimize the risk of leaving a file in an inconsistent state.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Preventing Data Inconsistency:**\n",
    "   - If multiple processes or programs are accessing the same file, leaving a file open might result in data inconsistency or unexpected behavior. Closing files when done ensures that other programs can access and modify them correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example demonstrating the importance of closing a file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"w\")\n",
    "file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "# Close the file to ensure data is saved\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from the file\n",
    "file = open(\"example.txt\", \"r\")\n",
    "content = file.read()\n",
    "print(content)\n",
    "# Close the file after reading\n",
    "file.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, calling `file.close()` ensures that all written data is saved and that system resources are freed after reading the file. To handle file operations more safely and conveniently, you can use the `with` statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Using 'with' statement\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"Hello, World!\")\n",
    "# No need to explicitly call close()\n",
    "\n",
    "with open(\"example.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "# File is automatically closed after the block\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement is recommended because it automatically handles closing the file, even if exceptions occur within the block, ensuring that resources are always properly released."
