    "The `with` statement is used in Python to manage resources, such as file operations, more efficiently and safely. When used with `open()`, it provides several advantages over explicitly opening and closing files. Here's an explanation of why the `with` statement is used and its advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use the `with` Statement?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `with` statement is designed to simplify the handling of resources that need to be cleaned up after use. It is often used with context managers, like files, where resources need to be released properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Using `with` Statement with `open()`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Resource Management:**\n",
    "   - The `with` statement ensures that the file is automatically closed when the block of code is exited, whether it is due to reaching the end of the block or because an exception was raised. This automatic cleanup is handled by the context manager protocol (`__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods), which ensures proper resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Simplified Syntax:**\n",
    "   - Using the `with` statement eliminates the need to explicitly call `file.close()`, reducing the risk of forgetting to close a file. This leads to cleaner and more readable code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Exception Safety:**\n",
    "   - If an exception occurs within the `with` block, the file is still properly closed. This reduces the likelihood of resource leaks and ensures that resources are freed even in error situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Prevents Resource Leaks:**\n",
    "   - Not closing files can lead to resource leaks, which may exhaust system resources like file handles. The `with` statement helps prevent this by ensuring files are always closed properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Consistent Behavior:**\n",
    "   - The `with` statement provides consistent behavior when working with files and other resources that support the context management protocol. It encourages best practices in resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example demonstrating the use of the `with` statement with `open()`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file using 'with' statement\n",
    "with open(\"career_goal.txt\", \"w\") as file:\n",
    "    file.write(\"I want to become a data scientist\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from the file using 'with' statement\n",
    "with open(\"career_goal.txt\", \"r\") as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(\"File Content:\")\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Writing:**\n",
    "  - The `with open(\"career_goal.txt\", \"w\") as file:` line opens the file in write mode. When the block is exited, the file is automatically closed, regardless of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **File Reading:**\n",
    "  - The `with open(\"career_goal.txt\", \"r\") as file:` line reopens the file in read mode. The file is automatically closed when the block is exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement simplifies file handling and reduces the likelihood of errors, making your code more robust and easier to maintain."
