    "### REST Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "- REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.\n",
    "- It is stateless and resource-based, with each resource identified by a URI.\n",
    "- Typically uses JSON or XML for data interchange.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages:**\n",
    "- Simplicity and ease of use.\n",
    "- Scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "- Widely supported and easily integrated with web technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOAP Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview:**\n",
    "- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol that uses XML for message formatting.\n",
    "- It is designed to handle complex operations and supports features like transactions and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shortcomings of SOAP:**\n",
    "1. **Complexity**: More complex due to its strict standards.\n",
    "2. **Performance Overhead**: XML-based messaging can be slower and result in larger message sizes.\n",
    "3. **Tight Coupling**: Leads to tighter coupling between client and server due to strict contracts.\n",
    "4. **Limited Browser Support**: Not as easily supported by web browsers as REST.\n",
    "5. **Slower Development**: Requires more configuration and setup, leading to slower development times.\n"
