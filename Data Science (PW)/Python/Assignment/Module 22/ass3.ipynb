    "### Explanation of Threading Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `run()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `run()` method is the entry point for a thread. When a thread's `start()` method is called, it internally invokes the `run()` method to execute the thread's code.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Typically, you don't call `run()` directly. Instead, you call `start()`, which in turn calls `run()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread {self.name} is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a thread\n",
    "thread = MyThread()\n",
    "# Calling run() directly (not recommended for starting a thread)\n",
    "thread.run()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `start()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `start()` method starts the thread by invoking the `run()` method in a separate thread of control.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Used to begin the execution of the thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "class MyThread(threading.Thread):\n",
    "    def run(self):\n",
    "        print(f\"Thread {self.name} is running\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a thread\n",
    "thread = MyThread()\n",
    "# Starting the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `join()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `join()` method blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Used to ensure that the main program waits for the thread to complete its execution before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "    print(\"Worker thread finished\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a thread\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "# Starting the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "# Waiting for the thread to complete\n",
    "thread.join()\n",
    "print(\"Main thread continues after worker thread has finished\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. `isAlive()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: The `isAlive()` method returns `True` if the thread is still running and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Used to check if a thread is still executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "    print(\"Worker thread finished\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating a thread\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "# Starting the thread\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checking if the thread is alive\n",
    "print(\"Is thread alive?\", thread.isAlive())\n",
    "\n",
    "# Waiting for the thread to complete\n",
    "thread.join()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Checking again if the thread is alive\n",
    "print(\"Is thread alive?\", thread.isAlive())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`run()`**: Contains the code to be executed by the thread. Typically, you override this method in a subclass.\n",
    "- **`start()`**: Begins the thread's activity by calling the `run()` method in a separate thread.\n",
    "- **`join()`**: Blocks the calling thread until the thread whose `join()` method is called terminates.\n",
    "- **`isAlive()`**: Returns `True` if the thread is currently executing, `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
