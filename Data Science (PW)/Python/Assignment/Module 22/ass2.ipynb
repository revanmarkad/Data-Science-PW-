    "### Why Use the `threading` Module?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `threading` module in Python is used to create, manage, and control threads. It allows for concurrent execution of code, enabling multitasking and improving performance for I/O-bound operations. Here are some key reasons to use the `threading` module:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Concurrency**: Allows multiple operations to be executed concurrently, improving efficiency.\n",
    "2. **Responsiveness**: Keeps applications responsive by performing background tasks without blocking the main program.\n",
    "3. **Resource Sharing**: Threads share the same memory space, facilitating easier communication and data sharing compared to processes.\n",
    "4. **Simplified Synchronization**: Provides mechanisms to manage access to shared resources, ensuring thread-safe operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use of Specific Functions in the `threading` Module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. `activeCount()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns the number of thread objects that are currently active.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful for monitoring and debugging, to check how many threads are running at a given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating and starting threads\n",
    "threads = []\n",
    "for _ in range(3):\n",
    "    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "    threads.append(thread)\n",
    "    thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Active threads:\", threading.activeCount())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. `currentThread()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns the current `Thread` object corresponding to the caller's thread of control.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful to get information about the thread that is currently executing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    print(f\"Current thread: {threading.currentThread().getName()}\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating and starting threads\n",
    "thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "thread.start()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. `enumerate()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Returns a list of all `Thread` objects currently active.\n",
    "- **Use Case**: Useful for monitoring and debugging, to get a list of all active threads and their states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import threading\n",
    "import time\n",
    "\n",
    "def worker():\n",
    "    time.sleep(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Creating and starting threads\n",
    "threads = []\n",
    "for _ in range(3):\n",
    "    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)\n",
    "    threads.append(thread)\n",
    "    thread.start()\n",
    "\n",
    "active_threads = threading.enumerate()\n",
    "print(\"Enumerating all active threads:\")\n",
    "for t in active_threads:\n",
    "    print(t.getName())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`activeCount()`**: Returns the count of active threads.\n",
    "- **`currentThread()`**: Returns the current thread object.\n",
    "- **`enumerate()`**: Returns a list of all active thread objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these functions, developers can manage and monitor threads effectively, ensuring that multithreaded applications run smoothly and efficiently."
