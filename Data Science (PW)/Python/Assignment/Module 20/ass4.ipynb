    "### 1) `try` and `else`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `else` block is used in conjunction with `try` and `except` blocks. The `else` block runs only if no exceptions were raised in the `try` block. It is often used for code that should only execute if the `try` block succeeds without any errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def divide_numbers(a, b):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        result = a / b\n",
    "    except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # This block runs if no exceptions occur in the try block\n",
    "        print(\"Division successful. Result:\", result)\n",
    "\n",
    "divide_numbers(10, 2)  # Successful division\n",
    "divide_numbers(10, 0)  # Division by zero\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Division successful. Result: 5.0\n",
    "Error: Cannot divide by zero.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) `finally`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `finally` block always executes after the `try` and `except` blocks, regardless of whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, such as closing files or releasing resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def read_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        file = open(filename, 'r')\n",
    "        data = file.read()\n",
    "        print(\"File content:\\n\", data)\n",
    "    except FileNotFoundError:\n",
    "        print(\"Error: File not found.\")\n",
    "    finally:\n",
    "        # This block always executes, even if an exception occurs\n",
    "        print(\"Closing file.\")\n",
    "        try:\n",
    "            file.close()\n",
    "        except UnboundLocalError:\n",
    "            print(\"File was not opened.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "read_file(\"existing_file.txt\")  # File exists\n",
    "read_file(\"nonexistent.txt\")    # File does not exist\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "File content:\n",
    " <content of the file>\n",
    "Closing file.\n",
    "Error: File not found.\n",
    "Closing file.\n",
    "File was not opened.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) `raise`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `raise` statement is used to manually raise an exception. This is useful for generating exceptions when certain conditions in your code are met, allowing you to control the flow of execution based on custom error conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def validate_age(age):\n",
    "    if age < 0:\n",
    "        # Manually raise an exception if the age is negative\n",
    "        raise ValueError(\"Age cannot be negative.\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        print(\"Age is valid:\", age)\n",
    "\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    validate_age(25)  # Valid age\n",
    "    validate_age(-5)  # Invalid age\n",
    "except ValueError as e:\n",
    "    print(\"Exception:\", e)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Age is valid: 25\n",
    "Exception: Age cannot be negative.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- **`try` and `else`:** Use `else` to execute code if the `try` block succeeds without exceptions.\n",
    "- **`finally`:** Use `finally` for code that must run regardless of exceptions, such as cleanup.\n",
    "- **`raise`:** Use `raise` to manually trigger exceptions based on specific conditions.\n",
    "\n",
