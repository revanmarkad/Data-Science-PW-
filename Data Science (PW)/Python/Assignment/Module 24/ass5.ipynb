    "In relational databases, **primary keys** and **foreign keys** are crucial concepts used to define relationships between tables and ensure data integrity. They help maintain a well-structured database by uniquely identifying records and establishing connections between related data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **primary key** is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. The primary key enforces entity integrity by ensuring that no two rows can have the same primary key value, and it cannot contain `NULL` values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of a Primary Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniqueness**: Each value in the primary key column(s) must be unique across the table.\n",
    "- **Non-null**: A primary key cannot contain `NULL` values.\n",
    "- **Single Column or Composite**: A primary key can consist of a single column or multiple columns (composite key).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a table `students`:\n",
    "\n",
    "| student_id | first_name | last_name | email               |\n",
    "|------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 1          | John       | Doe       | john.doe@example.com|\n",
    "| 2          | Jane       | Smith     | jane.smith@example.com|\n",
    "| 3          | Alice      | Johnson   | alice.j@example.com|\n",
    "\n",
    "In this table, `student_id` is the primary key because it uniquely identifies each student.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE students (\n",
    "    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    email VARCHAR(100)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Foreign Key\n",
    "\n",
    "A **foreign key** is a column or a set of columns in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. The foreign key establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring referential integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Characteristics of a Foreign Key:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Referential Integrity**: A foreign key ensures that the value in a column (or group of columns) matches the value in the referenced primary key column(s) in another table.\n",
    "- **Optional Uniqueness**: Foreign keys do not have to be unique and can contain `NULL` values, depending on the relationship type (e.g., many-to-one, one-to-many).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables: `students` and `enrollments`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`students` table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| student_id | first_name | last_name | email               |\n",
    "|------------|------------|-----------|---------------------|\n",
    "| 1          | John       | Doe       | john.doe@example.com|\n",
    "| 2          | Jane       | Smith     | jane.smith@example.com|\n",
    "| 3          | Alice      | Johnson   | alice.j@example.com|\n",
    "\n",
    "**`enrollments` table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| enrollment_id | student_id | course_id |\n",
    "|---------------|------------|-----------|\n",
    "| 101           | 1          | 1001      |\n",
    "| 102           | 2          | 1002      |\n",
    "| 103           | 1          | 1003      |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `student_id` in the `enrollments` table is a foreign key that references `student_id` in the `students` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE enrollments (\n",
    "    enrollment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    student_id INT,\n",
    "    course_id INT,\n",
    "    FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Primary Key**: Ensures each row in a table is unique and cannot be `NULL`. It defines the main identifier for a record within a table.\n",
    "- **Foreign Key**: Establishes a relationship between two tables and ensures that values in one table correspond to values in another, maintaining data integrity across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "These keys are fundamental in relational database design, enabling efficient data retrieval and enforcing consistent data relationships."
