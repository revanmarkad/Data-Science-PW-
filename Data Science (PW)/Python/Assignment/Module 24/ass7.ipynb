    "In SQL, the order of execution for query clauses is important for understanding how a query is processed and how results are produced. SQL queries are typically written in a certain logical order, but the database engine processes them in a specific sequence. Hereâ€™s the order of execution of SQL clauses:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Order of Execution\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM**: \n",
    "   - Determines the source of the data by specifying tables or views from which to retrieve data.\n",
    "   - Handles any joins to combine data from multiple tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE**: \n",
    "   - Filters rows based on specified conditions. \n",
    "   - Only rows that meet the conditions proceed to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY**: \n",
    "   - Aggregates data into groups based on one or more columns.\n",
    "   - Used with aggregate functions like `SUM()`, `COUNT()`, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING**: \n",
    "   - Filters groups created by the `GROUP BY` clause.\n",
    "   - Similar to `WHERE`, but operates on groups rather than individual rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT**: \n",
    "   - Specifies the columns to be returned in the result set.\n",
    "   - Applies any column expressions or aliases.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **DISTINCT**: \n",
    "   - Removes duplicate rows from the result set.\n",
    "   - Operates on the result of the `SELECT` clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **ORDER BY**: \n",
    "   - Sorts the result set based on one or more columns.\n",
    "   - Can sort in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **LIMIT / OFFSET**: \n",
    "   - Limits the number of rows returned by the query.\n",
    "   - `OFFSET` skips a specified number of rows before beginning to return rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Query\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary\n",
    "FROM employees\n",
    "WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'\n",
    "GROUP BY department\n",
    "HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000\n",
    "ORDER BY avg_salary DESC\n",
    "LIMIT 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Example Query\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **FROM employees**: \n",
    "   - The query starts by determining the data source, which is the `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01'**: \n",
    "   - Filters the rows to only include employees hired after January 1, 2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **GROUP BY department**: \n",
    "   - Groups the remaining rows by the `department` column.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000**: \n",
    "   - Filters groups to include only those with an average salary greater than 50,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **SELECT DISTINCT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary**: \n",
    "   - Selects distinct departments and calculates the average salary for each department.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY avg_salary DESC**: \n",
    "   - Sorts the results by `avg_salary` in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **LIMIT 10**: \n",
    "   - Limits the result set to the top 10 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the order of execution helps in constructing efficient SQL queries and optimizing database performance, as each step relies on the output of the previous one."
